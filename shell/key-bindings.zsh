# Enable the default zsh options (those marked with <Z> in `man zshoptions`)
# but without `aliases`. Aliases in functions are expanded when functions are
# defined, so if we disable aliases here, we'll be sure to have no pesky
# aliases in any of our functions. This way we won't need prefix every
# command with `command` or to quote every word to defend against global
# aliases. Note that `aliases` is not the only option that's important to
# control. There are several others that could wreck havoc if they are set
# to values we don't expect. With the following `emulate` command we
# sidestep this issue entirely.
'emulate' 'zsh' '-o' 'no_aliases'

# This brace is the start of try-always block. The `always` part is like
# `finally` in lesser languages. We use it to *always* restore user options.
